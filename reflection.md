Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class was inspired by the character Alex from the video game Minecraft. In the game, she represents the player and can do all of the actions listed in the interface. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I chose to not implement any addtional methods.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I enjoyed having the freedom to come up with my own class that fits all of the methods in the interface. Unfortunately, I had a significant amount of work this week and was not able to be as creative with this assignment as I would've liked, but I will make my final project much more exciting than this.
